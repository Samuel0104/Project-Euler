# Problem 38
## _Pandigital Multiples_



Take the number $192$ and multiply it by each of $1$, $2$, and $3$:

$$
\begin{align}
  192 \times 1 &= 192\\
  192 \times 2 &= 384\\
  192 \times 3 &= 576
\end{align}
$$

By concatenating each product we get the $1$ to $9$ pandigital, $192384576$. We will call $192384576$ the concatenated product of $192$ and $(1, 2, 3)$.

The same can be achieved by starting with $9$ and multiplying by $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$, giving the pandigital, $918273645$, which is the concatenated product of $9$ and $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$.

What is the largest $1$ to $9$ pandigital $9$-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with $(1, 2, \dots, n)$ where $n > 1$?
