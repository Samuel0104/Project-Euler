## _Champernowne's Constant_



An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

$0.12345678910 {\color{red}\mathbf 1} 112131415161718192021 \cdots$

It can be seen that the $12$<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part is $1$.

If $d_n$ represents the $n$<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

$$
d_1 \times d_{10} \times d_{100} \times d_{1000} \times d_{10000} \times d_{100000} \times d_{1000000}
$$
