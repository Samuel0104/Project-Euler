# Problem 31
## _Coin Sums_



In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

<li>1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).</li><br>

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

<li>1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p</li><br>

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
