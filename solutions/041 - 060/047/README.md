## _Distinct Primes Factors_



The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

$$
\begin{align}
    14 &= 2 \times 7\\
    15 &= 3 \times 5.
\end{align}
$$

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

$$
\begin{align}
    644 &= 2^2 \times 7 \times 23\\
    645 &= 3 \times 5 \times 43\\
    646 &= 2 \times 17 \times 19.
\end{align}
$$
