# Problem 46
## _Goldbach's Other Conjecture_



It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

$$
\begin{align}
    9 = 7 + 2 \times 1^2\\
    15 = 7 + 2 \times 2^2\\
    21 = 3 + 2 \times 3^2\\
    25 = 7 + 2 \times 3^2\\
    27 = 19 + 2 \times 2^2\\
    33 = 31 + 2 \times 1^2
\end{align}
$$

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
