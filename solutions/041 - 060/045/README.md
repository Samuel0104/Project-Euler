# Problem 45
## _Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal_



Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp; $T_n = n(n + 1)/2$&emsp; $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \dots$<br>
Pentagonal &nbsp; $P_n = n(3n - 1)/2$ &nbsp; $1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \dots$<br>
Hexagonal &ensp; $H_n = n(2n - 1)$&emsp;&nbsp; $1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \dots$

It can be verified that $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
