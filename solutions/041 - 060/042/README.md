# Problem 42
## _Coded Triangle Numbers_



The $n$<sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, $t_n = \frac{1}{2}n(n + 1)$; so the first ten triangle numbers are:

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is $19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_{10}$. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using [words.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samuel0104/Project-Euler/main/solutions/041%20-%20060/042/words.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
