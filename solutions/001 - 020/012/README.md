# Problem 12
## _Highly divisible triangular number_



The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7$<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

$$
\begin{align}
     \mathbf 1 &\colon 1\\
     \mathbf 3 &\colon 1, 3\\
     \mathbf 6 &\colon 1, 2, 3, 6\\
     \mathbf{10} &\colon 1, 2, 5, 10\\
     \mathbf{15} &\colon 1, 3, 5, 15\\
     \mathbf{21} &\colon 1, 3, 7, 21\\
     \mathbf{28} &\colon 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
\end{align}
$$

We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
