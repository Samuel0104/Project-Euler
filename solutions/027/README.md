## _Quadratic Primes_



Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

$$n^2 + n + 41$$

It turns out that the formula will produce $40$ primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \leq n \leq 39$. However, when $n = 40$, $40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by $41$, and certainly when $n = 41$, $41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by $41$.

The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces $80$ primes for the consecutive values $0 \leq n \leq 79$. The product of the coefficients, $-79$ and $1601$, is $-126479$.

Considering quadratics of the form:

<li>$n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| < 1000$ and $|b| \leq 1000$</li><br>
<li>where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$</li>
<li>e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$</li><br>

Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.
