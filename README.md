# Project Euler

Every solved problem has a program that prints its runtime right after the answer (all written in Python).

Some solution programs include comments with a brief explanation of the mathematics or the logic used in order to implement the code. Also, there might be multiple programs for a single problem.

Many solutions depend on my library module: [eulerlib.py](https://github.com/Samuel0104/Project-Euler/blob/main/solutions/eulerlib.py)
