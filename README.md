# Project Euler
Every solved problem has a program that prints its runtime right after the answer (all written in Python). Some solution programs include a brief explanation of the mathematics or the logic used in order to implement the code.

Many solutions depend on my library module: [eulerlib.py](https://github.com/Samuel0104/Project-Euler/blob/main/solutions/eulerlib.py)
